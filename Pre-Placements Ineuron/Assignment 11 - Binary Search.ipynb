    " - Import the Counter class from the collections module, which provides a convenient way to count the occurrences of elements in an array.\n",
    " - Create two counters, counter1 and counter2, by passing nums1 and nums2 to the Counter constructor respectively. This will create dictionaries that map each unique element to its frequency in the respective arrays.\n",
    " - Initialize an empty list called intersection to store the elements of the intersection.\n",
    " - Iterate over the elements in counter1 using a for loop.\n",
    " - For each element num, check if it is present in counter2 using the in operator.\n",
    " - If the element is present in both arrays, calculate the minimum count between the two arrays using the min() function.\n",
    " - Append the element num to the intersection list min_count times using the extend() method with a list comprehension.\n",
    " - After iterating over all elements in counter1, the intersection list will contain the elements that appear in both arrays, considering their count.\n",
    " - Return the intersection list.\n",
